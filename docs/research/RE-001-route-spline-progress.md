# RE-001 — Route/spline progression: PC reference vs current GameCube prototype

**Research date:** 2026-10-20  
**Status:** PC-source evidence recorded; current prototype mapped; Step 102 mapping **not verified**.  
**Scope limit:** This dossier investigates route representation and progress only. It does not determine the correct console implementation, prove the complete original-PC progress path is functional in this reconstruction, or approve any code/data import.

## The question

How does the reviewed SW_RACER_RE PC source represent a route position and advance along a spline, and how does that compare with the track-sampling and lap-progress model currently used by Boonta's clean-room GameCube prototype?

## Sources and revision

- **Upstream project description:** the SW_RACER_RE README says the project documents/re-implements selected functions to support modding; it explicitly does not aim for matching compilation or a complete decompilation. Its reported 71.2% function-analysis figure is dated 2026-06-12 and describes analysis coverage, not completed implementation. See the [upstream README](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE).

## Observed facts

### PC reference — linked spline cursor

1. **The loaded route is structured data, not only a list of positions.** `swrSpline_LoadSpline` opens a spline block, reads the spline count and offset bounds, rejects an out-of-range spline index, loads the selected block into an asset buffer, establishes a runtime control-point pointer, and converts selected multi-byte fields to the expected in-memory representation. The control points contain position/orientation/handle data and links such as `next1`/`next2`, plus connection counts.
2. **Progress can be translated into a cursor state.** `swrSpline_CursorSeekToProgress` uses `progress / 10` as a segment/node band and converts the remainder to a normalized segment parameter. Beyond the simple band range, it consults branch metadata (`unk_set`) and chooses a linked path through stored connection fields.
3. **The cursor can traverse the connection graph.** `swrSpline_CursorStep` examines the current lead node's connection count and the cursor's branch selector; it advances through the selected next node or marks a dead end. This is evidence of branch-capable traversal in this PC implementation.
4. **Position and orientation are sampled together.** `swrSpline_CursorEvaluate` advances the segment parameter by cursor velocity times the PC frame delta, moves across node links when the parameter crosses a segment boundary, clamps the parameter, and interpolates position, tangent and up direction. `swrSpline_EvaluateToMatrix` builds a coordinate basis from the tangent and up direction.
5. **A whole-track length is exposed.** `swrSpline_GetTrackLength` returns cached route length; `swrRace.c` uses this value to normalize at least some race/AI pacing parameters.
6. **The reconstructed PC lap-progress calculation uses spline progress, not simple distance division.** `swrRace_LapProgress` combines a control point's baked progress base with `segmentT` scaled by that segment's span. Closed tracks clamp at 0.9999 so the wrap can be detected; point-to-point tracks clamp at 1.0. See [swrRace_LapProgress and swrRace_LapCompletion](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE/blob/a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab/src/Swr/swrRace.c#L4663-L4740).
7. **Lap crossing compares normalized progress with a high-water mark.** Near the wrap, the logic can subtract 1.0 from progress above 0.8 so crossing the finish reads as overtaking a negative high-water value. For an open track, the helper reports completion at progress 1.0. This is source-level logic, not proof that the full race-progress path works end to end.
8. **The surrounding end-to-end progress path is unfinished in this reviewed reconstruction.** `swrRace_UpdateRaceProgress` calls `swrRace_AdvanceSplineCursor`, track-mesh lookup, spline binding/offset updates, and then lap completion. In this same revision, `swrRace_AdvanceSplineCursor`, `swrRace_GetTrackMeshAtCursor`, `swrRace_UpdateSplineBinding`, and `swrRace_ComputeTrackOffset` are `HANG("TODO")` stubs. See [the progress update path](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE/blob/a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab/src/Swr/swrRace.c#L4742-L4800). The reconstructed repository exposes useful lap-progress logic but does not supply a fully working reference implementation for route advancement.

### Additional PC detail — curve families, cursor state, and mesh mapping

The pinned source distinguishes three spline types in `src/types_enums.h`:

- `SPLINE_TYPE_BSPLINE = 0`: cubic B-spline interpolation over a four-node lookahead window. Position uses four control-point positions; the spline-type-specific basis also determines the tangent.
- `SPLINE_TYPE_BEZIER_FLAT = 1`: cubic Bezier interpolation from the start/end positions and their `handle2`/`handle1` control handles. Its up direction is fixed to +Z in the inspected interpolation routine.
- `SPLINE_TYPE_BEZIER = 2`: the Bezier position path with rotation/up information interpolated rather than the flat +Z special case.

These are directly visible in [the pinned spline type enum](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE/blob/a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab/src/types_enums.h) and [`swrSpline_Interpolate`](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE/blob/a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab/src/Swr/swrSpline.c#L86-L177). This is an important design distinction: the same cursor interface can evaluate curves whose control-point layout and orientation data differ. The current dossier does not identify which curve types appear in the retail GameCube version.

The source describes a cursor as a 0x30-byte state containing a spline pointer, velocity, normalized segment parameter `segmentT`, cached tangent length, four node-lookahead indices, start/end flags, a branch selector, and branch-history flags. `swrSpline_CursorEvaluate` advances the parameter by `velocity * swrRace_deltaTimeSecs`, repeatedly steps forward or backward when the parameter exits [0, 1], clamps at a path end, and evaluates position, tangent and up together. `swrSpline_CursorStep` selects a linked next node using the branch selector and available next-link count, while preserving enough branch bits to resolve later lookahead nodes. See [the cursor declaration notes](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE/blob/a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab/src/Swr/swrSpline.h) and [cursor stepping/evaluation](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE/blob/a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab/src/Swr/swrSpline.c#L180-L313).

A second layer is intended to connect the route to the visible track: the comments in `swrSpline.h` describe a build pass that traces graph paths to create per-node normalized progress values and bakes ten cursor samples per node into a sample-to-track-mesh lookup. This must be treated as **documented intent, not fully verified executable behavior**: in the pinned revision, repository search did not locate function bodies for the declared `swrSpline_TraceProgress`, `swrSpline_BuildProgressTable` or `swrSpline_Build` routines, and the race-update path calls `HANG("TODO")` stubs for track-mesh lookup, cursor advancement and spline binding/offset updates. The data model is informative, but the reconstructed source does **not** provide a complete executable reference for the full pod-to-track progression path.

### Cross-check against the frozen Steam PC decompilation

**Additional reference found on 2026-10-20:** [`DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/tree/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef). Its README says it is a frozen Ghidra decompilation of the **Steam PC version**, retained as a reference for types, signatures and addresses. This is a different evidence source/build context from the pinned `SW_RACER_RE` revision. No root `LICENSE` file was found in the queried repository, so this is a **read-only analysis reference only**: do not copy or adapt its implementation into this project.

The useful discovery is that this snapshot contains function bodies for several addresses that remain `HANG("TODO")` in the reviewed `SW_RACER_RE` reconstruction:

- [`FUN_0047f6f0`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047f6f0.c) is the post-load spline builder. It checks the spline/control-point input, resets progress state where needed, calls the graph-progress builder with a `100.0` sampling parameter, then walks the spline again with a `10.0` sampling parameter to bake a spline-sample-to-track-mesh association. It optionally runs a validation pass.
- [`FUN_0047f470`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047f470.c) initializes the per-node progress/order tables and enumerates connected control-point paths and branch choices. It dispatches each selected route path to the trace routine, rather than assuming the entire spline is one linear list.
- [`FUN_0047f060`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047f060.c) repeatedly evaluates a spline cursor along a selected path and accumulates distances between evaluated positions. Those accumulated distances populate a per-node normalized progress base and a span for the segment parameter. This supports the conclusion that the PC progress table is intended to approximate arc length over the connected route, not simply divide the control-point index by node count.
- [`FUN_0047ee20`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047ee20.c) walks the connected path and invokes a callback at the requested sample density; the builder passes `10.0` and a callback at `0x0047ea20` to bake the sampled-route-to-track-mesh lookup.
- [`FUN_0047f8e0`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/src/_text23.c) corresponds by address to the stub named `swrRace_AdvanceSplineCursor` in `SW_RACER_RE`. The decompilation advances the cursor in small segment-parameter steps while comparing the player's position against the current/next spline frame; it flags forward/backward node-plane crossings and estimates the time within the frame when the start node is crossed.
- [`FUN_0047fbb0`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/src/_text23.c) corresponds by address to `swrRace_UpdateSplineBinding`. Its body checks the associated track mesh and its spline-related flags, can reseed the cursor from a mesh's stored spline sample, then refreshes the cursor-associated track-mesh/projection state.
- [`FUN_0047fca0`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/src/_text23.c) corresponds to `swrRace_ComputeTrackOffset`; it derives a scalar offset and a normalized direction vector relative to the sampled spline/track frame. The exact semantic interpretation of those fields remains a candidate for later field-level verification.

#### Sampling density and callback boundary — additional verified detail

The frozen Steam PC snapshot allows the **sampling schedule** to be stated more precisely, while leaving one important callback detail unresolved:

- [`FUN_0047f6f0`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047f6f0.c) runs two separate passes: `FUN_0047f470(..., 100.0, ...)` to prepare route progress, then `FUN_0047ee20(..., 10.0, ..., &LAB_0047ea20)` for the sample-to-mesh pass.
- [`FUN_0047f060`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047f060.c) advances the evaluated cursor in `1 / density` parameter increments and sums distances between consecutive 3D samples. With the builder's `100.0` density, this is an approximately 100-interval-per-segment chord-length approximation used to assign a progress base and segment span. It is not an analytic arc-length solution.
- [`FUN_0047ee20`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047ee20.c) traverses candidate connected paths and their branch/lookahead choices; for each eligible segment it resets the segment parameter to 0 and calls the callback at `t = 0.0, 0.1, ... 0.9` before advancing to the next segment. In other words, `10.0` is **parameter-space density**, not a promise of equal world-space distance between samples.
- [`FUN_0047e8b0`](https://github.com/DeonPoncini/swep1r_decomp/blob/d988c6408a91aaf8a0e65dbdbe32b0dbb4b970ef/c/FUN_0047e8b0.c) independently uses the same progress-band structure: divide the progress value by 10 for the node band, use the remainder to derive `segmentT`, and consult stored branch metadata when the value falls outside the direct node-index range.

**Callback limit:** the builder passes the raw code label `0x0047ea20`, not a separately named `FUN_0047ea20` visible in the snapshot's function inventory. The reviewed decompiled sources expose the traversal and call contract, but not a clean, separately inspectable callback body under that name. Therefore the exact lookup-record fields and the callback's individual writes remain **unverified**. The defensible conclusion is the two-pass architecture and its sampling densities—not a fully reconstructed mesh-association structure.

These observations are frozen-Steam-PC evidence only. They do not establish GameCube/Wii parity or justify porting the PC implementation.

This provides a substantially better **PC-side behavioral reference** for the missing route lifecycle: build the cursor graph/progress tables → sample and associate spline points with track meshes → advance the cursor across track-node planes → rebind it when the active mesh changes → compute the local track offset → detect lap crossing from normalized progress. It also explains why reading `swrRace_LapProgress` alone was insufficient: that helper consumes progress-table entries prepared by the spline-build stage and a cursor maintained by the race-update path.

**Limits:** these are decompiler-derived observations for the frozen Steam PC executable. The current `SW_RACER_RE` source remains stubbed in these places, and exact source/build parity between these PC references is not established. None of this verifies GameCube/Wii behavior or the candidate Step 102 source. It improves the PC hypothesis and identifies what to compare once the console source is available; it does not justify copying the code or porting this architecture to the current prototype.

### Current GameCube prototype — closed curve and scalar distance

1. The runtime samples the checked-in generated test track through `track_sample_at`. It caches Euclidean straight-line distances between adjacent control points, wraps each point's successor with modulo point count, and uses those chord lengths to locate a parameter (t = target / segmentLength) for Catmull–Rom interpolation. This is a chord-based approximation to distance along the smoothed curve: the inspected function does not build an arc-length lookup table for the Catmull–Rom curve itself, so constant travelled-distance increments are not proven to yield constant physical distance on the smoothed curve. The runtime explicitly requires a closed-loop track with at least four points.
2. The race state keeps one scalar `g_distance`. Each active frame advances that distance using current speed, boost and pitch; it updates the lap count from the floor-divided previous/current distance against `RACE_LAP_DISTANCE`. The race finishes when the counter reaches the configured three-lap limit.
3. The distance-based lap helper is defensive around non-finite values, backward distance and overflow. Those are useful safety properties, but they are not evidence that the original game uses the same route model.

### Quantitative check — current synthetic test oval (offline calculation, 2026-10-20)

The pinned prototype commit is also the current `main` head at the time of this check. I evaluated the eight authored control points in [`generated_track.h`](https://github.com/Master-Chiken/boonta-reborn-88/blob/fa8cee047ae8e74c30c87cd94977c434bb1c7398/gamecube-demo/source/generated_track.h) using the same Catmull–Rom interpolation formula as `track_sample_at`, and numerically sampled each of the eight segments with 20,000 subdivisions.

- The generated header sets `BOONTA_TRACK_LENGTH = 181.232191`; recomputing the straight-line chord lengths between its eight control points gives **181.23219**.
- The sampled Catmull–Rom curve length is approximately **184.56396**, about **3.33177 units / 1.838% longer** than the chord sum.
- The mapping from the prototype's nominal travel distance to 3D movement is not locally uniform: `|dP/dt| / chordLength` ranges from approximately **0.5546 to 1.2467** across the sampled segments. This is a numerical property of the current eight-point test oval, not a measurement of retail-game physics or an observed player complaint.

**Equal-step displacement check:** I then reproduced `track_sample_at` over the full loop and measured the 3D centerline displacement for successive nominal distance increments of 0.1 units (1,813 increments, including the final shorter interval). The displacement ratio `worldDistance / nominalDistance` ranged from **0.5549 to 1.2467**, with median **1.0359**, 5th percentile **0.7221**, and 95th percentile **1.2407**. The minimum occurred near nominal distance 133.5 (segment 5); the maximum near 58.8 (segment 2). Using 1.0-unit steps produced a similar range, **0.5559 to 1.2459**, so this is not merely an artefact of the chosen small step. These values reproduce the published interpolation/sample mapping numerically; they are not measurements from a running Dolphin session.

**Reference freshness check:** I compared the current `SW_RACER_RE:master` against the pinned PC revision `a9863edd4caaa573f89ff634fa7d1cd6d41738ab`. It is 29 commits ahead, but the compare result includes no changes to `src/Swr/swrSpline.c` or `src/Swr/swrRace.c`; fetching those files at current `master` confirms that the critical route-advance, track-mesh lookup, spline-binding and track-offset routines remain `HANG("TODO")` stubs. The pinned PC analysis is therefore not superseded in this specific area by the newer default-branch source.

**Interpretation boundary:** this does not establish a lap-count bug. Both `track_sample_at`'s `fmodf(travelled, total_length)` and `RACE_LAP_DISTANCE` use the same chord-sum length, so the scalar-distance lap boundary and the parametrized course wrap are aligned. The finding is narrower: the smoothed course's world-space movement per nominal distance varies by segment and within a segment. It may influence perceived movement speed, but a visible gameplay test is needed before treating it as a defect.

**Reproducible next check:** compare equal increments of `g_distance` with the resulting world-position deltas on this same test oval; record minimum/maximum displacement and the segment locations. Do not change the runtime solely from this offline result. A true arc-length lookup table is only a candidate if a repeatable gameplay symptom or an explicit fidelity requirement justifies it.

## Comparison

| Dimension | PC reference evidence | Current GameCube prototype | Confidence / limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Route representation | Spline header plus control-point records, connection links and branch metadata | Authored point sequence sampled as a closed Catmull–Rom loop | High for these two codebases; no conclusion yet about Step 102 |
| Position along route | Cursor stores segment parameter/node lookahead and can traverse linked nodes | Scalar travelled distance selects a location on the closed curve | High for current source |
| Branch handling | The inspected PC cursor uses next-node connections and branch selection | The inspected prototype path has no equivalent spline-graph cursor in this path | High for the inspected functions; may not describe every subsystem |
| Orientation | Route position, tangent and up direction feed a matrix basis | Track frame is derived from nearby samples of the closed curve | High for inspected functions |
| Lap progression | `swrRace_LapProgress` / `swrRace_LapCompletion` use normalized spline progress, a high-water mark and wrap handling; the caller's route-advance path contains TODO/HANG stubs | Floor-divided travelled distance increments laps and ends after three laps | High for inspected code; full PC runtime path remains incomplete in this reconstruction, and console parity is unknown |
| GameCube/Wii parity | PC source only | Step 102 console candidate not mapped here | **Unknown** |

## Interpretation — what this tells us (and what it doesn't)

The prototype's current route is a compact, controllable test-course model. The PC reference contains a more explicit spline-cursor/connection-graph abstraction that can express branch choices and returns position/orientation as a route sample. Its reconstructed lap-progress helper uses normalized spline progress and a wrap/high-water comparison, while the prototype counts laps using travelled distance. The PC caller path is still incomplete because key movement/binding helpers are TODO/HANG stubs. These are materially different models.

That difference makes route/cursor mapping a high-value reverse-engineering question before a large implementation decision. It does **not** prove that the GameCube version uses the same graph layout, the same PC format, the same route data or the same lap-trigger logic. Nor does it prove that porting the PC design is automatically correct for GameCube. The original console candidate must be inspected before choosing an architecture.

## Step 102 mapping status

**Not verified in this pass.** The project register references a private `Star_Wars_Racer_GameCube_Step102.zip` candidate and a separate manifest, but those files were not available in the connected file workspace for this research pass, and they are not checked into the public repository. Therefore, no Step 102 filename/function is claimed as inspected.

**Availability re-check (2026-10-20):** Rechecked the connected conversation-file list and Library metadata; the named Step 102 source ZIP and its manifest still are not available for inspection. No console source file/function is claimed as mapped. This is an input blocker, not a reason to start implementation or substitute a commercial game ROM/disc image.

The next Step 102 task is to inspect only the candidate source archive's route/race files and tests locally, match actual file contents to the PC observations above, and record each file's provenance/license status. Do not upload commercial game archives/ROMs/disc images or extracted assets to hosted tools; do not publish the Step 102 archive or bulk-import it.

## Next question (not active until RE-001 is reviewed)

After the route/cursor comparison is accepted, take a separate evidence block for **PC pod-control/traction**: trace how player input becomes target turn rate, how the target is capped by vehicle stats/pace, how current turn rate changes over delta time, and how traction blends desired velocity with current velocity. Then compare those responsibilities with the prototype's scalar lateral-velocity/damping helpers. Do not change those helpers until the comparison has a source-linked specification.
